**Beat Saber Extensions** is a set of StreamerBot commands intended to improve/extend the capabilities of BeatSaberPlus for streamers who broadcast Beat Saber.

## üöÄ Features

* `!bsrlookup` ‚Äì See if a BSR ID has been played and view the streamer‚Äôs score (via BeatLeader API)

* `!bsrqueue` ‚Äì Show the long form song request queue (moderator only)
* `!bsrbump` ‚Äì Bump a request (with error validation and optional auto-bump for raiders)
* Easily trigger song bump via from other StreamerBot actions (see: [‚ö°  Triggering Song Bumps From Your Own Actions](#triggering-song-bumps-from-your-own-actions))

## üìú Changelog

### [0.1.2] - 2025-07-12

* Fixed various edge-cases related to the automatic raid request bump functionality
  * Fix for StreamerBot edge case where certain BSR Ids from raid request command input being parsed incorrectly
  * Added check for if the request is already in the queue for a different user
  * Added special handling for when the queue is closed using `!att`
* Added the ability to trigger song bumps from any StreamerBot action

### [0.1.1] - 2025-06-06

* Fixed missing triggers related to raid requests
* Added configurable `DefaultQueueItemCount`
* Refactored Logger

> [!Note]
> I have identified an issue where the BeatLeader API will sometimes return `401 Unauthorized` causing `!bsrlookup` to fail and I'm currently working on a fix

### [0.1.0] - 2025-06-01

* Added user-configurable values via StreamerBot arguments
* `!bsrlookup`: Now properly locates the most recent score rather than just the user's top/pinned score for a beatmap
* Additional edge case validation during song bumps with appropriate error messages
* Automatic bumping for song requests from raiders (*Optional*, can be enabled via user-configurable setting).
* New commands `!bsrenable`/`!bsrdisable`: Allows the broadcaster or a moderator to enable or disable all non-moderator commands provided by this module (for example, if the streamer is not currently playing Beat Saber)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### üìã Requirements

* StreamerBot 0.2.4 or later
* BeatSaberPlus Beat Saber Plugin (tested with version `6.4.0`, but should work with earlier versions)
* BeatLeader profile (for `!bsrlookup` command)

### üì• Importing Into StreamerBot

* Copy StreamerBot Import String from [StreamerBot Import File](Beat%20Saber%20Extensions%20For%20StreamerBot.sb) and paste into the `Import` menu in StreamerBot (or download the file and click+drag it into the import window).
* Commands will be imported in a disabled state, so you will need to navigate to the `Commands` tab and enable all of the commands. They can all be found in the `Chat Commands - Beat Saber Extensions` subgroup in the commands tab.
* Check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you run into any issues.

* Notes:
  * **Beat Saber Extensions** will not initially know the location of your Beat Saber install, but it will automatically detect it the first time that one of the commands gets used while Beat Saber is running. This setting is stored in a global variable, and is updated automatically when the path associated with the currently running `Beat Saber.exe` process is detected to have changed.
  * **Beat Saber Extensions** will not initially know the streamer's BeatLeader ID. The first time the `!bsrlookup` command is used, it will attempt to determine the streamer's BeatLeader ID by triggering the `!bsprofile` BeatSaberPlus command.

## üßµ Commands

> [!Note]
> Typically, when autocompleting the username for a chatter with a localized display name (Japanese/Chinese/Russian/etc.), most chat clients will autocomplete the user's display name. StreamerBot cannot identify users by display name alone, but **Beat Saber Extensions** automatically identifies users with special display names and keeps track of them using StreamerBot user groups so that localized display names can be used as input for commands.

For commands accepting a `User` argument (`!bsrmyqueue`, `!bsrwhen`, `!bsrbump`), you can provide either a username or a display name. Names may be provided with or without the `@` prefix.

## Triggering Song Bumps From Your Own Actions

You can trigger a song bump from any of your own StreamerBot actions. The only requirement is that your action must populate the `user` argument with a valid username. Any StreamerBot trigger related to user activiaty (Channel Reward Redemption for example) will always populate this argument automatically, so for most trigger types, you shouldn't need to configure arguments at all.

To trigger a raid bump for your action, simply add an `Execute C# Method` sub-action to your action. This is all that's needed to have your action trigger a song bump for the user who triggered your action (e.g. for a Channel Reward Redemption trigger, it willbe the user who used the redeem).

If the user has multiple requests in the queue, the most recently added request will be bumped. If you'd like some sort of different bump behavior besides most recently added (like bumping a specific beatmap ID), I'd be happy to add some options if you let me know via a GitHub issue (or pester me when I'm live at <https://www.twitch.tv/bamo16>).

## üß™ Building/Modifying

### üíª Editing In External IDEs

If you'd like to edit this code in some way, you'll likely want to load it in your IDE of choice.

üßµ **Recommended reading:**  
[Writing Streamer.bot C# code with linting in Visual Studio Code](https://gist.github.com/rondhi/aa5e8c3b7d1277d1c93dd7f486b596fe "Github Gist by rondhi")

The project's `.csproj` files are set up to load the required StreamerBot assemblies (like `Streamer.bot.Plugin.Interface`), but they won‚Äôt resolve unless you specify the path. They will attempt to use a property called `DotnetAssembliesPath` to find these files. To define a value for `DotnetAssembliesPath`, create a`Directory.Build.props` file in both:

* `/BeatSaberExtensions/BeatSaberExtensions`
* `/BeatSaberExtensions/GroupManager`

**Example:**

```xml
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
        <!-- Replace this with the path to the root of your StreamerBot folder (where the .exe is) -->
        <DotnetAssembliesPath>P:\RYAN\Streaming\Dotnet Assemblies</DotnetAssembliesPath> 
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Note: The code contained in the **Beat Saber Extensions** Execute C# Code subaction is spread across multiple project files which need to be merged into one to paste into StreamerBot. I am unfortunatelly not ready to share the build tool which performs this task, but I will try to share it in the future.

## Troubleshooting

* If StreamerBot shows compiler errors for one or both Execute C# SubActions
  * This is likely due to missing references. StreamerBot should load these automatically on import, but if it does not for some reason, here are the needed references for each action. You can add each one my opening the Execute C# SubAction and navigating to the References tab:
    * **Beat Saber Extensions**
      * `mscorelib.dll`
      * `System.dll`
      * `System.Core.dll`
      * `System.Net.Http.dll`
      * `System.Web.dll`
    * **Group Manager**
      * `mscorelib.dll`
      * `System.dll`
      * `System.Core.dll`
